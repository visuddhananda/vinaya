	- 죽이려는 의도가 없었으므로 아빳띠가 아니다. 예를 들어 개미를 거미줄에 던졌지만 죽이려는 의도가 없었다고 해보자. 그럼 범계가 아니다. Q가능성을 알아도 범계가 되지 않나요? A 그렇다. 하지만 거미줄을 제거하는 것이 더 적절해보인다.

	  I think I didn't say the truth. Is it lie? A 그런 것은 거짓말로 치지 않는다. 당시에 상대를 속이려는 의도가 있었던 것이 아니기 때문이다. 예를 들어 어느 반떼가 밥이 충분하냐고 물었는데 그렇다고 했지만 알고보니 없었다. 그걸 거짓말이라고 하지 않는다. 그런 말을 다와 바바나(?)라고 한다.    #sila

- 가끔 인터뷰 때 닛사야가 필요하면 하라고 하는데요. 얼떨결에 따라했는데 생각해보니 우꾸마라 비왐사는 저희 우뻬짜야입니다. 닛사야를 요청할 필요가 있나요? A 없다. 우꾸마라 비왐사가 승원에 오는 순간 자동으로 관계가 되므로. #sila
- Q 마하야나 빅쿠에게 자기 수행이나 증득에 대해 이야기할 수 있나요?A (범계는 아니지만) 적절치 않다. 우리는 그들을 적절한 빅쿠라고 보지 않는다. 사마네라에게도 증득은 이야기할 수 없다. #sila
	- Q 일반적인 수행방법이야기는 되나요? A 그것은 되지만 조심해야 한다. 만약 자신이 까시나 수행 중이라고 하면 결국 아나빠나 선정 후에 하는 것으로 유추할 수 있다. 그래서 증득한 사람이란 인상을 줘 보시를 받거나 한다면 적절치 않다.
	- Q
	- 배경설명을 드리자면 저번 인터뷰 때 마하야나 빅쿠 있는데서 비왐사께서 인터뷰를 진행하셨습니다. 저는 마하야나 빅쿠나 빅쿠니 앞에서 재가자와 마찬가지로 수행 이야기는 못하는 것으로 알았습니다. 저희는 증득이 없으니 진행하신 건지 잘 모르겠습니다.
	- 그래서 찬나 수마나 반떼에게 질문한 건데 범계는 아니라고 하는 것 같은데 적절치는 않다 뭐 이런 이야기로 들었습니다.
	- 우리 반떼가 꾸사와띠에게 일반적 질문을 했다고 하는 것도 들었고 꾸사와띠님에게 어디까지 증득했냐고 물어 자신이 들은 이야기도 들었습니다.
	- 배웠지만 수행 이야기에 대해서는 어디서 어디까지 해야하는지 헷갈립니다. 같은 출가자면 사미나 셰얄레이에게 물을 수 있는건지도 헷갈립니다.
	- A 담마다야다
	  collapsed:: true
		- 인터뷰 시간에는 여건상 조건을 완벽히 만들기 어렵고 증득 관련 내용이 없다고  봐서 진행했을 것입니다.
		- 빅쿠가 섀야레이에게 수행 관련 질문을 하는것, 어디까지 증득해는지 물어 보는 것도 바람직하지 않습니다. 섀얄레이 제자가 되고 싶은가요?
		- 미먄마에서는 가끔 선배 빅쿠가 후배 빅쿠에게 배우는 겸우가 있습니다.
		  그후배 빅쿠가 자신이 가르친 선배 빅구를 '나의 제자'라고 언급하는 것을 여러 번 들었습니다.
		- 빅쿠가 섀얄레이에게 어디까지 증득했느냐고 물어보는 것은 매우 가볍게 보입니다. 박쿠의 위의를 떨어뜨리는 일이 될 수도 있습니다.
		- 약간의 예외적인 경우 말고 스승이외의 사람과 수행 관련 이야기를 삼가는 것이 좋습니다.
- 잡초를 밟아도 됩니까? 비닐을 덮어도 되는가? We can not spoil or damage living plants. But there are many weed(not important glass) in the monastery especially the road in the kutti to kutti. #sila

		- 주석서에서는 사실 씨앗조차 밟아선 안된다고 되어있다. 하지만 주석서는 또한 설명하기를 이것을 길이라고 결정을 하고 밟으면 범계가 아니다라고 한다. 그래서 일반적으로 숲길 같은 곳을 걸을 수 있다. 하지만 그렇게 결정할 수 없는 곳도 있다.
		- 길에 무엇을 빅쿠 스스로 씌우더라도 이것을 꾸띠를 보호하기 위한 목적으로 씌운다면 범계가 아니다. 하지만 풀을 손상시키려고 씌운다면 범계.
- 셰얄레이 관련 질문 #sila
	- 셰얄레이에게 자기 수행을 물어봐도 되나요?
		- 적절하지 않다. 증득에 대해 말하면 아빳띠다.
	- 그들은 상가인가요?
		- 그들은 상가에 속하지 않는다. 그들은 사마네리가 될 수 있는(become) 위치다. 그러나 빅쿠니가 없기 때문에 그렇게 될 수가 없다. 빅쿠니가 사마네리 계를 줄 수 있기 때문이다.
	- 그들을 정식 출가자로 볼 수 있나요?
		- 그렇지 않지만 출가자로 여겨야(consider)한다. 그들은 상가와 가까우며(familiar) 그들도 포기하고 계를 지키기 때문이다.
	- 섀얄레이는 상가에 속하지 않음. 여성 십계 출가자로 여기면 됨. 이 빅쿠도 섀얄레이 정체성에 대해서 잘 모름. 섀얄레이에게 섀얄레이 수행. 증득과 빅구의 수행, 증득을 물어보는 것 모두 바람직하지 않음. #담마다야다
	- 섀얄레이에게 발우 사욤 금지가 내려진 것을 봤음. #담마다야다

- 탁발 때 보시자 얼굴 보지 말아야하는데 이야기를 해도 되는가.  축원을 해도 되는가. Can we say something to devotee in alms round order? Not for monastery work #sila
	- 문제없다. 하지만 먹는 도중에 이야기한다면 적절치 않다. 그건 빅쿠끼리도.
		- 탁발 시 무슨 고기인지 묻는 것 외 할 말이 거의 없음. 축원은 식사 후 함.
		  입에 음식을 넣은 채 말하면 안 됨.
- 보시음식 개한테 줘도 되는가 . Can we dana our alms food to dogs or animal? And can we raise animal?  #sila
	- 줘도 문제없다. 하지만 승원에 따라 주면 안된다고 공지하기도 함. 이건 계율이라기보다 승원 운영에 문제가 될 수도 있는 것. 자꾸 주면 자꾸 낳아서 승원 유지에 어려움을 줄 수 있으므로.
	- Q. 붓다께서 동물을 기르지 말라고 금지하셨다고 들었는데.
		- 그런 내용은 없다. 다만 승원에 피해주는 동물에 대해 막으신 적은 있다. 붓다 또한 매우 친절하신 분이다.  음식을 준다는 것을 금지하는 계율은 없다.
			- 승원에서 개에게 음식 주는 것은 적절허지 않음. 승원에서는 먹을 말큼만 받아오는데 개에게 줄 것이 없음. 산에 살며 탁발한다면 남는 음식을 동물에게 줄 수 밬에 없는 상황.

	- I have some woman corpse(dead body) picture and a lot of disgusting picture for repulsiveness. But there are some sexual organs in the picture like bust. If bhikkhu see that picture, is it appatti? Of course I see this for repulsiveness
	- 그런 의도로 시체를 보더라도 여성의 몸을 계속해서 주시하면 범계다. 시체더라도 성기가 나오고 그것에 따라 성적 욕망이 일어날 수 있다. 주석서에서 말하기를 여성이 옷을 100겹 입고 있다하더라도 의도를 가지고 응시하면 둑가따 아빳띠다라고 한다.

- 의심나는데 행동한다면 I heard from vinaya class. If bhikkhu eat meat with having doubt about what kind of meat, it is appatti. Is this only for this rule or for all vinaya? #sila

	- I used to raise hand with palm to palm to senior bhikkhu. Sometime I go to downside and senior bhikkhu go to upaide then I pay homage to senior by seeing down. Is it ok?
	- 내려다보며 합장해도 문제없다. 후배 빅쿠에게 합장해도 문제없다. 하지만 절은 안됨.
	- 하지만 합장을 하면 적당하지 않은 순간들이 있다. 식사를 한다거나 목욕을 한다거나 할 때 하면 안된다.
		- 내리막길에서 산배 빜구에게 합장하는 것은 괜찮습니다. 후배 빅쿠에게 절하면 안됨. 합장하는 것도 거의 보지 못함.
- 개미 쎄게 쓸기 #sila
	- As far as I know, we can sweep ants or insects with broom. So I used to sweep ants and put in the basket and throw away. Then sometime i think I have intention to use vinaya rule.
	- I know if I sweep strongly, ant is damaged and can not move quickly. So I think I intentionally sweep strong. because if ants move quickly they can run out from basket. I have to catch them again. If I sweep strongly with intention to damage, is it appatti?
	- 죽이려 했는데 죽지 않고 다치기만 했다면 둑가따. 그래서 플라스틱 빗자루 말고 순한 갈색 빗자루로 쓰는 것이 좋음.

	- 둘째. 빅쿠가 승원에 계좌 가짐.
		- 또 하나는 승원 계좌. 승원 계좌가 더 나음. 예를 들어 누군가 200달러를 보시하고 싶다 했다. 안전한 곳을 알려주십쇼라고 깝삐야가 함 함. 그럼 빅쿠가 그 계좌(자기 명의 은행 계좌가 아닌 여기같은 승원 필수품 수첩을 의미하는 듯)를 알려줌.
		- 그럼 깝삐야가 가짐. 빅쿠는 못 만짐. 깝삐야가 관리. 빅쿠가 요청하면 그걸로 물건 마련. 이것이 율. 이것을 고려해 (누군가는) 은행 계좌도 가능하다고 생각. 안전한 곳이 은행이나 승원 계좌라는 것. 깝삐야가 거기다 두고 빅쿠가 원하면 깝삐야가 마련하는 식으로 가능.
		- @어쨋간에 그럼 은행 계좌 가능하다는 건가? 누군가는 싫어하고(dislike) 누군가는 가능하다 봄. @미얀마는 어떤가. 누군가는 가지고 누군가는 안가지고. 우리는 없다.
		- 파욱 사야도께서는 '빅쿠가 은행 계좌를 가진단 말인가?'라고 하신 말씀을 들은 적이 있습니다. 우짠디마 사야도 앞서 파욱 사야도의 시자를 하시던 우꾼다다나 사야도도 은행 계좌를 가지는 것은 안 된다고 하심. 우꼬위다 사야도도 출가하면 포기해야 한다고 하셨고 우레와따 반떼도 유사한 답을 하셨음. 미얀마에서 빅쿠의 은행 계좌를 허용한다는 것이 아니라 몇몇의 주장일 뿐일 것입니다. 승원 계좌라는 것은 승원 깝삐야 명의나 친척 또는 다른 재가자 명의의 은행 계좌로 빅쿠 필수품을 관리하고 빅쿠가 필요할 때 마련해 주는 것입니다. 그것의 보조 수단으로 빅쿠 숫자가 많다보니 편리상 수첩에 기록하여 관리하는 것임. 몇몇의 의견으로 된다, 안된다를 논하기 보다 이때 대표준에 근거하여 판단할 필요가 있고 출리의 가르침에도 비추어 봐서 판단해야 함. 스리랑카에서 괜히 금지하는 것이 아닐 것임. #담마다야다

		- 모욕하려는 의도없이 빅쿠가 다른 사람에 대해 농담하면 상대가 농담 또는 모욕으로 알아듣든지 관계 없이 둡바시따(나쁜 말, 악설)를 범합니다.
		  빅쿠가 모욕하는 주제 중의 하나를 언급하고 모욕적인 뜻으로 동료 빅쿠에게 한마디 하면 그것이 농담이라도 빠찟띠야를 초래합니다. 그 말이 농담을 뜻하면 다른 사람이 모욕을 느껴도 둡바시따를 초래합니다.
			- @해피반떼 사례는 좀 헷갈립니다. 당사자(해피 반떼)가 아니고 제 삼자에게 모욕하려는 의도(한량같다고 약간 비웃는 의미이므로)로 말했다면 제삼자가 그 비웃는 의도를 알아차리면 둡빠시따인가요. 아니면 제삼자에게 이야기라면 범계가 아닌가요?

	- 위나야를 보니 출가하지 않은 사람의 잘못된 행위는 중대하거나 중대하지 않거나 둑까따 근거라고 나오는데요. 이것은 출가하지 않은 사람의 잘못된 행위를 출가자끼리 이야기해도 그런가요.
		- 빅쿠가 재가불자의 구체적 범계와 중대하거나 그렇지 않은 범계를 동시에 출가하지 않은 사람에게 말하지 않는다면 범계가 아니라고 되어 있습니다.
		  그러므로 ‘저 사람에게 그런 부탁하지 않는 것이 좋다’라는 식으로 말하는 것은 문제가 없을 것입니다. 구체적 범계 행위와 범계 종류(등급)를 동시에 말하지 않았기 때문입니다.
		  여기서는 빅쿠가 출가하지 않은 사람에게 범계를 말하는 것을 다루므로 빅쿠끼리 그런 말을 하는 것은 해당하지 않는다고 볼 수 있습니다. #담마다야다- DONE 의심되는 계란 음식의 경우  #sila #음식

				- 의심이 가고 먹지 않을 것이라면 받지 않는 것이 좋습니다. 거절하기도 전에 모르는 사이에 이미 발우에 놓았다면 자신이 먹지 않는 음식을 놓는 테이블에 두면 됩니다. 고기나 계란 자체가 여법하게 마련된 것이라면 받아 먹을 수 있으나 의심이 간다면 먹지 않는 것이 좋겠지요. 보시자는 쳐다보지 않아야 하지만 보시되는 음식에 항상 눈을 두고 주의를 기울여야 합니다.

	- Answer 20: According to Theravada Tipitaka, the person is not a real bhikkhu or samanera. But if he is honest and his mind is pure, then there is no problem for him to take a new full ordination in this present life.
	- According to Theravada Buddhism, in the area outside India, there must be at least five bhikkhus to form the sangha for bhikkhu¡¯s ordination. If, among the five bhikkhus, one has committed parajaka, then the candidate cannot become a bhikkhu. If there are more than ten bhikkhus in the ordination hall, one of them has committed parajaka but the others haven¡¯t, and if they recite kammavaca totally, then the candidate can become a bhikkhu.- DONE 로얄디 7일 강장제 여부 #sila #음식

  collapsed:: true
	- 앞으로 출가 예정자나 남녀 재가 불자가 오는 경우 어떻게 대처하며 지낼 것인가에 대해 생각해 보는 시간입니다. 다음 몇 가지 사항을 권장합니다.
	- ‘혹시 재가불자가 필요한 것이 있느냐고 해도 바로 부탁하지 않는 것이 좋습니다.’
	- ‘재자불자를 도울 일이 있으면 돕되 그에게 잘 보이려고 하지 않는 것이 좋습니다.’
	- ‘재가불자를 자기편으로 만들려 애쓰지 않는 것이 좋습니다.’
	- ‘재가불자에게 이런 말을 하면 화목한 빅쿠 사이를 갈라놓지는 않을까라고 생각하고 말하는 것이 좋습니다.’
	- ‘재가불자든 빅쿠든 극단적으로 싫어하거나 극단적으로 좋아하지 않으려고 노력해야 합니다.’
	- 위의 사항들은 빅쿠로 살아가는 한 유념하는 것이 좋습니다. 특히 재가불자가 필요한 것이 있느냐고 물어볼 때 미얀마 계사들도 갓 계를 받은 빅쿠들에게 바로 부탁하지 말라고 주의를 준다고 합니다. 재가불자는 눈앞에서 이것저것을 하겠다거나 무엇을 보시하겠다고 하지만 얼마 안 가서 마음이 변하기 쉽기 때문입니다. 실례로 미얀마에서 재가불자가 필요한 것이 있으면 요청하라는 말을 듣고 나중에 어떤 빅쿠가 부탁했더니 그 재가불자가 부탁을 들어주지 않았다는 일이 있었습니다. 물론 말을 해놓고 나중에 보시하는 사람도 있습니다. 시간이 지나면서 적절한 상황에 따라 부탁할 일도 생길 수도 있겠으나 조심하는 것이 좋습니다. 필요한 것이 있으면 당분간 이 빅쿠에게 이야기하기 바랍니다.- 아빳띠데사나가 유효하지 않은 조건 5가지 #sila

	- 재가불자에게 빅쿠 사이를 갈라 놓을 수 있는 말을 하지 않음.- 재가자 대할 때 주의사항 #sila #담마다야다
	- 앞으로 출가 예정자나 남녀 재가 불자가 오는 경우 어떻게 대처하며 지낼 것인가에 대해 생각해 보는 시간입니다. 다음 몇 가지 사항을 권장합니다.
	- ‘혹시 재가불자가 필요한 것이 있느냐고 해도 바로 부탁하지 않는 것이 좋습니다.’
	- ‘재자불자를 도울 일이 있으면 돕되 그에게 잘 보이려고 하지 않는 것이 좋습니다.’
	- ‘재가불자를 자기편으로 만들려 애쓰지 않는 것이 좋습니다.’
	- ‘재가불자에게 이런 말을 하면 화목한 빅쿠 사이를 갈라놓지는 않을까라고 생각하고 말하는 것이 좋습니다.’
	- ‘재가불자든 빅쿠든 극단적으로 싫어하거나 극단적으로 좋아하지 않으려고 노력해야 합니다.’
	- 위의 사항들은 빅쿠로 살아가는 한 유념하는 것이 좋습니다. 특히 재가불자가 필요한 것이 있느냐고 물어볼 때 미얀마 계사들도 갓 계를 받은 빅쿠들에게 바로 부탁하지 말라고 주의를 준다고 합니다. 재가불자는 눈앞에서 이것저것을 하겠다거나 무엇을 보시하겠다고 하지만 얼마 안 가서 마음이 변하기 쉽기 때문입니다. 실례로 미얀마에서 재가불자가 필요한 것이 있으면 요청하라는 말을 듣고 나중에 어떤 빅쿠가 부탁했더니 그 재가불자가 부탁을 들어주지 않았다는 일이 있었습니다. 물론 말을 해놓고 나중에 보시하는 사람도 있습니다. 시간이 지나면서 적절한 상황에 따라 부탁할 일도 생길 수도 있겠으나 조심하는 것이 좋습니다. 필요한 것이 있으면 당분간 이 빅쿠에게 이야기하기 바랍니다.- NOW 땅위서 낙엽 태워도 되나 #sila

	- This is related to NP 18. take gold and silver problem.
	- Now, I heard that from some sayalay some devotee offered allowable requisites to me. That sayalay said 'request this allowable requisites to kappiya.
	- As far as I know we can not say to kappiya about allowable requisites. Only we can do is invited by kappiya. They have to say first. Then Can I meet the kappiya because of another thing. even they don't invite me.
	- If kappiya don't say allowable requisites. Should I just say 'bhikkhu don't accept the money?
	- If I say 'bhikkhu don't accept the money?’ and then kappiya said by proper method. Then Can I use those allowable requisites?
	- A... Who is the donor? donor is sayalay or anyone? (Another people) Then he directly inform or not ok. For example I offer allowable requisites to the kappiya if you something you ask them, you (can) ask the kappiya. You ask from the kappiya If it is so then you can directly say the kappiya without invitation no problem. If original donor say in this way it is ok.
	- Also the kappiya is here in the office. usually they write down and give the paper to you then this is also invitation although they don't say from the mouth. no problem. They give the paper? (No, I didn't meet the kappiya) Then you should ask original donor first. You should here such kinds of paper already write down here. This is from the invitation letter from the office. They will not directly say to you. If they give to you then according to the requisites, you can ask kappiya. (But donor is in the korea). No. If korea, if you have contacted if you can directly ask. If he directly invited ok.

			- I have strong mana, conceit, pride. So many wandering thought about mana arise. For example, In my thought I teach or preach to someone. Now even I can not control myself well but I used to think that kind of things. I know this is very disgusting And I also used to compare to another person, then I feel a sense of inperiority. If I encounter mana, what is yoniso manasikara?
			- In Vitakkasaṇṭhāna Sutta 맛지마니까야, bhikkhu bodhi translate it as The Removal of Distracting Thoughts. Buddha said five way of removal wandering thoughts. breifly first is attention to other sign connected with what is wholesome, second is to examine the danger in those thoughts. three is to try to forget those thoughts and should not give attention to them. I understood first and second but I could not understand third. What is meaning of this? If I could forget about that I might already do.

You ask from the kappiya If it is so then you can directly say the kappiya without invitation no problem. If original donor say in this way it is ok.
	- Also the kappiya is here in the office. usually they write down and give the paper to you then this is also invitation although they don't say from the mouth. no problem. They give the paper? (No, I didn't meet the kappiya) Then you should ask original donor first. You should here such kinds of paper already write down here. This is from the invitation letter from the office. They will not directly say to you. If they give to you then according to the requisites, you can ask kappiya. (But donor is in the korea). No. If korea, if you have contacted if you can directly ask. If he directly invited ok.

	- If big monastery, don't we need to follow this?

	- Is this all for sangha office bhikkhu? Or for all bhikkhu?
		- 상가 오피스를 위한 의무는 아니지만 보통 상가 오피스 빅쿠를 먼저 만난다. 우리 승원 같은 경우는 대부분 말하고 오지만 아닌 경우도 있다. 내 스리랑카 승원도 갑자기 빅쿠 오면 이런 걸 다 일러줘야.
	- If we go another monastery for vassa. We didn't follow this. is it appatti?
		- 사실은 어떤 것들은 스스로 할 수 있는 거지만 만약 그 승원의 어느 거주 빅쿠도 이 의무를 하지 않았다면 그 승원 빅쿠 모두 아빳띠. 신참 고참. 우빳짜야 다 가리지 않는다. 방문 빅쿠 만났으면 이걸 해야. 물론 누가 오는지 모를 수도 있고 언어 문제도 있겠지만. 언어 몰라도 바디랭귀지로 설명 가능

Now even I can not control myself well but I used to think that kind of things. I know this is very disgusting And I also used to compare to another person, then I feel a sense of inperiority. If I encounter mana, what is yoniso manasikara?

Buddha said five way of removal wandering thoughts. breifly first is attention to other sign connected with what is wholesome, second is to examine the danger in those thoughts. three is to try to forget those thoughts and should not give attention to them. I understood first and second but I could not understand third. What is meaning of this? If I could forget about that I might already do.
